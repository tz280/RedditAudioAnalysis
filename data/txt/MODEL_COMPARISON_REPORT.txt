REDDIT EARPHONE/AUDIO ENGAGEMENT PREDICTION
MODEL COMPARISON: CONTENT-ONLY vs. CONTENT + EARLY COMMENTS
================================================================================

TASK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regression: predict log(1 + score) for Reddit submissions.

MODEL DEFINITIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Model 1 (Content-Only, Causal):
  - Inputs available at posting time only:
    • Title + selftext (TF-IDF)
    • Subreddit (one-hot encoded)
    • Title length, selftext length
    • Posting hour of day, day of week

Model 2 (Content + Early Comments):
  - All features from Model 1, plus aggregated early engagement
    using comments posted in the first hour after submission:
    • Early comment count
    • Average early comment score
    • Maximum early comment score
    • Average early comment length
    • Standard deviation of early comment score

GLOBAL PERFORMANCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Model 1 (Content-Only):
  R²   = 0.1236
  RMSE = 0.8288
  MAE  = 0.4267

Model 2 (Content + Early Comments):
  R²   = 0.4849
  RMSE = 0.6186
  MAE  = 0.2932

PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCE (MODEL 2 – MODEL 1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ΔR²   = +0.3614
  ΔRMSE = -0.2102
  ΔMAE  = -0.1335

INTERPRETATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Model 1 captures the portion of engagement that can be explained purely
from content and posting time. Its R² reflects the intrinsic difficulty
of predicting social media engagement based only on what is known at
the moment of posting.

Model 2 shows how much additional variance becomes predictable once we
observe early engagement within the first hour. A substantial increase
in R² (for example, from ≈0.14 to ≈0.35–0.45) indicates that early
comments provide a strong signal for final outcomes.

This gap between Model 1 and Model 2 quantifies the contribution of
early engagement dynamics ("snowball effects") beyond pure content
quality.

PRACTICAL USE CASES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Model 1 (Content-Only):
  • Use before posting to compare alternative titles/selftexts.
  • Run counterfactuals for content strategy (A/B testing).

Model 2 (Content + Early Comments):
  • Use after 1 hour to prioritize potentially viral posts.
  • Support moderation or recommendation decisions.
