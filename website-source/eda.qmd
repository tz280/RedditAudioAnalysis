## Business Question 1: How Does Public Discussion About Audio Products Evolve Over Time?

### Objective

Identify **daily, weekly, and long-term posting rhythms** across different audio communities to understand engagement cycles and temporal behavior patterns among users.

### Methodology

* Extracted temporal features: `hour`, `day_of_week`, `month`, and `year` from the `created_utc` timestamp.
* Aggregated post counts and average scores by subreddit and time window.
* Compared engagement trends across major subreddits (`headphones`, `audiophile`, `Airpods`, `SonyHeadphones`, etc.).
* Visualized trends via time series plots and heatmaps illustrating posting activity by hour and day.

### Findings

![Hourly comments by subreddit](../data/plots/eda_hourly_comment_count_by_subreddit.png)
![Hourly within-subreddit %](../data/plots/eda_hourly_within_subreddit_percent.png)
![Total comment share](../data/plots/eda_total_comment_share.png)
![Weekly comments by subreddit](../data/plots/eda_weekly_comment_count_by_subreddit.png)
![Weekly within-subreddit %](../data/plots/eda_weekly_within_subreddit_percent.png)

**Key Insights:**

* **Headphones** and **Audiophile** dominate the ecosystem, accounting for nearly **70%** of all comments.
* The overall traffic for smaller subreddits are low (Earbuds, Sony), however have a higher baseline than broader subreddits, i.e., doesn’t fluctuate as much.
* **AirPods** ranks third, reflecting strong but more specialized brand-oriented discussion.
* Posting activity peaks between **15:00–20:00 UTC (10 AM–3 PM EST)**, aligning with U.S. daytime hours.
* Weekly engagement peaks mid-week (Wednesday–Friday), indicating that weekdays drive higher participation.
* Hourly engagement patterns are globally synchronized, suggesting shared activity cycles across regions.

## Business Question 2: Which Product Communities Attract the Highest Engagement?

### Objective

Compare **brand-specific** and **general audio** subreddits to identify which communities exhibit the highest engagement based on posting frequency, average scores, and user interactions.

### Methodology

* Computed average score, number of comments, and posting frequency per subreddit.
* Ranked subreddits by mean engagement metrics.
* Measured user overlap to quantify cross-community participation.
* Utilized three key datasets:

  * `engagement_metrics.csv`: Subreddit-level engagement metrics.
  * `summary_statistics.csv`: Aggregated activity summaries.
  * `user_overlap_pairs.csv`: Pairwise user overlap across subreddits.

### Findings

![Median distribution analysis](../data/plots/eda_median_distribution_analysis.png)

The median score across most communities is **1**, confirming a highly skewed engagement distribution — a common characteristic in social media datasets.

#### 1. Brand vs. General Audio Overview

![Engagement mean analysis](../data/plots/eda_engagement_mean_analysis.png)

| Metric              | Brand | General Audio |
| :------------------ | :---: | :-----------: |
| **Mean Score**      |  3.5  |    **6.4**    |
| **Mean Comments**   |  3.1  |    **5.3**    |
| **Posts per Day**   |  26.3 |    **57.7**   |
| **Community Share** |  50%  |      50%      |

General Audio communities outperform Brand communities across all metrics, despite having equal representation.

## Business Question 3: How Does Post Timing and Structure Relate to Discussion Depth?

### Objective

Examine how the **timing** and **structure** of Reddit posts influence engagement levels (measured by comment counts and scores).

### Findings

#### 1. Temporal Engagement Patterns

![Hourly Posting Patterns](../data/plots/eda_q3_hourly_patterns.png)
**Peak Engagement Hour:** 14:00 UTC (2 PM) — Corresponds to U.S. morning hours.

![Day of Week Patterns](../data/plots/eda_q3_day_of_week.png)
**Best Day for Engagement:** Tuesday exhibits the highest average posting and comment activity.

#### 2. Visibility and Engagement Correlation

![Score vs. Comments](../data/plots/eda_q3_score_bins.png)

A **strong positive correlation (r = 0.685)** exists between post score and comment count.
High-scoring posts (>100) receive over 50 comments on average, while low-scoring posts (<10) typically receive fewer than 5.

#### 3. Post Structure Analysis

![Title Length Impact](../data/plots/eda_q3_title_length.png)
**Title Length:** Weak correlation (r = 0.061); title length minimally affects engagement.

![Content Type Comparison](../data/plots/eda_q3_content_type.png)
**Content Type:** Text (self) posts generate slightly higher engagement than link posts.

#### 4. Correlation Matrix

![Correlation Heatmap](../data/plots/eda_q3_correlation_heatmap.png)

**Key Insights:**

* **Timing matters:** Posts made between 13:00–16:00 UTC (U.S. mornings) and on **Tuesdays** attract the most engagement.
* **Visibility drives discussion:** High post scores are strongly linked to deeper conversations.
* **Skewed engagement:** A small number of viral posts dominate overall comment volume.
* **Title length negligible:** Minimal correlation (0.061) shows title length has little effect.
* **Content type secondary:** Text posts slightly outperform link posts, but differences are small.

## Summary

### Answers to EDA Business Questions

1. **Temporal Patterns:**
   The `headphones` and `audiophile` subreddits dominate overall activity, representing over two-thirds of all comments. Engagement peaks during U.S. daytime hours (15–20 UTC) with mid-week increases.

2. **Community Engagement:**
   General audio communities consistently outperform brand-specific ones in engagement metrics. `audiophile` and `headphones` are the central discussion hubs, while `airpods` is the strongest performer among brand subreddits.

3. **Post Timing and Structure:**
   Engagement depth correlates strongly with post visibility (r = 0.685), not structural features like title length or post type. Optimal posting times are Tuesdays around 14:00 UTC.

### Key Takeaways

* **Community Concentration:** A few large subreddits drive the majority of conversation, highlighting network centralization within the audio niche.
* **Engagement Dynamics:** Visibility and timing play a greater role in engagement than content form or title design.
* **Strategic Implication:** To maximize visibility, content creators and brands should align posting schedules with identified peak hours and focus on generating upvotes and early traction.
* **Behavioral Insight:** Cross-community participation indicates that the Reddit audio audience is highly interconnected and exhibits consistent temporal behavior patterns.
