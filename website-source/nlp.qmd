### Brand Analysis

**Findings:**

| Brand   | Total Mentions | Top Features                                      |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |

* **Samsung** and **Anker** stand out for perceived value and affordability.

---

**Summary:**
Reddit users primarily focus on **audio performance**, **battery endurance**, and **comfort**, but express the most frustration about **durability**, **app issues**, and **pricing**.
Overall sentiment remains positive, indicating strong satisfaction with sound and fit — yet there is room for improvement in longevity and software experience.




## Business Question 2: What earbud brand dominates controversial discussion in reddit? 

**Question:**
What earbud brand dominates most on discussion and how does discussion leads to, positive,negative or neutral?
what feature and concerns that reddit users are discussing for earbud brands?
---

### brand discussion

![text_length](data/plots/nlp_avg_text_length.png)
![sentiment_distribution](data/plots/nlp_sentiment_distribution.png)
![pos/neg/neutral](data/plots/nlp_posneg_ratio.png)

**Key Insights:**

* Among brands Sennheiser had the longest average text length and apple had shortest average text lengh.

* among all brands Beats had highest percentage on positive discussion among brands, where samsung had highest percentage on negative discussion.

* from plots, although sennheiser had longest average discussion among users, its positivity on discussion was one of the highest among brands and  samsung on the other hand had quite a large portion on discussion, but it had high portion of negative discussion.  

---

### Concern & Features

![problem_vs_feature ](data/plots/nlp_problem_vs_feature.png)
![feature](data/plots/nlp_feature_heatmap.png)
![concern](data/plots/nlp_concern_heatmap.png)

**Key Insights:**

* Almost every brand had more discussion on the product's feature, but samsung had more discussion on problems.

* For discussion on features, brand differs on feature discussion on reddit. for apple and samsung , discussion was mainly about app connection, which is one of the main reason why people use apple product.  For rest of the brands, what is interesting is that most of the discussion was about sound. Since these brands don't produce device itself, sound could be one of the most important factor to discuss on earbud market.

* In terms of concerns, issue was the main topic that was dealt in reddit. issue as refers as what can customers can do to handle product's issue.

## Business Question 3: What emotional reactions do Reddit users express toward different earbud features?

**Question:**
Which features trigger the strongest emotional responses—positive or negative—and how do these emotions differ across the earbud experience?

---

![Emotion Pain Points](data/plots/nlp_emotion_by_feature_heatmap.png)

### Top Pain Points by Negative Mentions

### Key Emotional Drivers

| Feature          | Primary Positive Signal | Primary Negative Signal |
|------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Sound Quality    | Joy                     | Mild negativity          |
| ANC              | Joy                     | Low anger                |
| Comfort          | Joy                     | Low negativity           |
| Connectivity     | —                       | **High anger**           |
| Durability       | —                       | **Highest negativity**   |
| Battery          | Joy                     | Sadness / fatigue        |
| Price            | Joy                     | Fairness frustration     |
| Mic Quality      | Joy                     | Moderate negativity      |


### Key Insights & Interpretation

#### 1. Reliability failures (durability, connectivity) generate the strongest negative emotions

- **Durability** shows the highest concentration of anger and sadness across all features.
  - → Users feel both immediate frustration (anger) and long-term disappointment (sadness) when earbuds break, degrade, or fail over time.

- **Water Resistance** shows the highe concentrations of anger and sadness across all features.


- **Connectivity** displays elevated anger with relatively low joy.
  - → Bluetooth instability tends to produce acute, high-intensity irritation — a "deal-breaker" emotion.

**Implication:**
These issues damage brand trust and are likely the top drivers of negative reviews, product returns, and churn. Fixing reliability problems yields outsized UX and retention gains.

---

#### 2. Battery issues evoke disappointment, not rage

- Battery-related discussions lean toward sadness over anger, signaling a softer but still negative emotional tone.
  - → Users don't feel blindsided — instead they feel let down, especially when batteries age sooner than expected.

**Implication:**
Battery anxiety is more about expectation mismatch than catastrophic failure. Managing expectations and communicating battery longevity honestly can reduce the emotional burden without needing major hardware redesigns.

---

#### 3. Core listening features (sound_quality, ANC, comfort) generate the highest joy

- Sound quality, ANC, and comfort consistently produce strong joy and trust signals — the most positive emotional categories.

- These features have the lowest levels of anger, disgust, and fear, showing stable satisfaction.

**Implication:**
These are primary value-creation features. When brands excel in these areas, users reward them with strong emotional positivity, leading to higher willingness to recommend and stronger brand affinity.

---

#### 4. Mic quality and transparency mode produce mixed emotions

- Both show moderate joy/trust but also noticeable sadness or frustration.

- Users appreciate these features, but performance is inconsistent across brands and models.

**Implication:**
These represent opportunity zones: not as emotionally volatile as durability, but with clear room to differentiate through better execution.

---

#### 5. Price drives trust and positive sentiment — but still triggers negativity when expectations aren't met

- Price surprisingly registers higher trust and joy compared to other "non-technical" features.

- Yet negative emotions appear when users feel the product under-delivers relative to cost.

**Implication:**
Pricing influences emotional framing:
- A reasonable price boosts trust, but disappointment becomes more intense when expectations don't match the price tag.

---

### Overall Insights & Business Takeaways

**Negative emotions are concentrated in failure-prone features**

- Durability
- Connectivity
- Battery

These features create emotional pain points that directly impact retention, brand loyalty, and review scores.

**Positive emotions cluster around experiential qualities**

- Sound quality
- ANC
- Comfort


### Summary 

The emotion heatmap shows that **failures feel personal, but great audio experiences feel meaningful**. Users express deep frustration over reliability issues (durability, connectivity, battery), but strong joy and trust toward experiential features (sound, ANC, comfort). These emotional patterns reveal not just product performance, but how each feature contributes to — or detracts from — the overall user experience, helping identify the biggest opportunities for product improvement and competitive differentiation.
