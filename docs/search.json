The primary technical challenges include severe class imbalance (77.5% neutral vs 6.2% negative posts) causing model bias toward majority class predictions, keyword-based labeling that misses nuanced language like sarcasm and context-dependent sentiment. Negative sentiment proves most difficult to detect with only 60-68% expected recall due to data scarcity and subtle expression patterns that avoid explicit negative keywords, while neutral posts containing mixed signals or balanced reviews create classification ambiguity beyond bag-of-words features."

Temporal Patterns Are the Strongest Signal (39.4%) - Bots post on automated schedules with low hour variance - Humans have irregular activity patterns (work, sleep, weekends) - Example: Posts daily at 9am, 3pm, 9pm (variance &lt; 1.0) = suspicious\n2. Activity Longevity Matters (17.9%) - Promotional campaigns have short lifespans (days to weeks) - Authentic enthusiasts participate for months/years - Short activity_span_days separates flash campaigns from genuine users\n3. Text Consistency Reveals Automation (9.2%) - Bots post similar-length comments (templates, scripts) - Humans write varied lengths based on context - Low text_length_variance detects copy-paste behavior\n4. Subreddit Diversity is Less Important (0.6%) - Many authentic users are brand loyalists - Temporal and text patterns are better discriminators - Brand-only posting is necessary but not sufficient for detection\n\n\n\nBusiness Implications\n1. Protect Data Quality for Consumer Insights - Filter suspicious accounts before sentiment analysis - Apply bot detector to user IDs before aggregating feedback - Ensure reliable consumer insights by removing 3.5% bot contamination\n2. Community Trust & Platform Health - Flag accounts with &gt;90% bot probability for moderator review - Implement automated rate limiting for suspicious patterns - Maintain authentic discussions in audio product communities\n3. Competitive Intelligence Applications - Detect competitor astroturfing campaigns - Identify coordinated promotion of specific brands - Track emergence of new promotional tactics\n4.

    "text": "Business Question 4: What underlying painpoint clusters exist in Reddit discussions about wireless earbuds, and how do these clusters differ across subreddits?\n\n\nProblem Formulation\n\nTask Type: Clustering\n\nInput Features: 7 painpoint signals extracted from text\n\nbattery, anc, comfort, price, durability, connectivity, sound\n\n\nObjective: Identify natural groupings of complaints and compare how subreddits differ in their dominant painpoint profiles.\n\n\n\n\nApproach\nWe apply K-Means clustering to 147,025 painpoint vectors (comments + submissions).\n\nSteps:\n\nLoad combined painpoint dataset\n\nEvaluate cluster counts using:\n\nElbow Method\n\nSilhouette Score\n\n\nSelect k = 9 (best silhouette score)\nFit final K-Means\n\nVisualize cluster centroids and subreddit distributions\n\n\n\n\n\nCluster Results\n\nBest Number of Clusters\nSilhouette-selected k = 9, indicating strong separation in complaint patterns.\n\n\nCluster Centroids\nEach cluster represents a dominant painpoint pattern. This heatmap shows the K-means cluster centers, where each row is a group of similar complaints and each cell reflects how often a specific painpoint (0 = rarely, 1 = almost always) appears in that cluster.”\n\nExamples: - Some clusters are dominated by sound complaints, others by battery, ANC, connectivity, or durability. - Several clusters show mixed patterns, such as battery + ANC or price + durability.\n\n\n\n\nSubreddit-Level Patterns\nWe compute how much each subreddit contributes to each cluster.\n\n\nKey Observations:\n\naudiophile, audio → High in sound-focused clusters\n\nbluetooth → High in connectivity-focused clusters\n\nBuyItForLife, Costco, running → Many durability/quality clusters\n\nAndroid, GooglePixel, apple → Mixed battery + ANC complaint clusters\n\nThis shows that each community has a distinct “complaint fingerprint.”\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation & Insights\n\n1. Complaint types fall into ~9 natural patterns.\nUsers consistently focus on a small set of core issues: sound, connectivity, battery, ANC, comfort, durability, and price.\n\n\n2. Subreddit communities emphasize different painpoints.\nTechnical subs care about connectivity, audiophile subs about sound, and lifestyle/value subs about durability.\n\n\n3. These clusters reflect different customer expectations.\nClustering reveals which communities prioritize premium sound, long-lasting gear, or reliable connectivity.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nReddit discussions naturally group into 9 painpoint clusters, each representing a distinct type of user dissatisfaction. These clusters vary significantly across subreddits, showing that each community has unique priorities (e.g., sound quality, connectivity reliability, durability, or price). This clustering provides a structured way to understand community-specific concerns and guide product or marketing strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAll ML code is in code/ml/ directory.

This project analyzes 9.5 million Reddit discussions across 23 audio-focused communities to extract actionable business intelligence through big data analytics, NLP, and machine learning. By examining authentic consumer conversations about wireless earbuds, headphones, and audio equipment, we identify purchase drivers, detect emerging issues, understand competitive dynamics, and predict market trends—enabling data-driven decisions for product development and marketing strategy.\n\nDataset\n\nSource: Reddit Comments and Submissions\nTime Period: June 1, 2023 - July 31, 2024 (14 months)\nSubreddits: 23 audio-focused communities\nScale: 9,525,830 total rows\n\nComments: 9,017,846\nSubmissions: 507,984\n\nSize: ~4.5 GB (Parquet compressed)\nStorage: AWS S3 distributed processing\nInfrastructure: 4-node Spark cluster\n\n\n\nBusiness Questions\nWe address 11 business questions spanning three analytical approaches:\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\n\nHow does public discussion about audio products evolve over time across subreddits, days, and hours?\nWhich product and brand communities attract the highest engagement and user overlap on Reddit?\nHow do post timing and structural characteristics (title length, content type) relate to discussion depth and engagement?\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP):\n\nWhat features (pain points & brands) and sentiments are most discussed about wireless earbuds on Reddit?\nWhich earbud brands dominate controversial discussion, and how does sentiment (positive/negative/neutral) differ across brands?\nWhat emotional reactions (joy, anger, sadness, trust, etc.) do Reddit users express toward different earbud features?\nHow did public sentiment and discussion volume respond to the AirPods Pro USB-C launch and the transition from Lightning to USB-C?\n\nMachine Learning (ML):\n\nHow well can we predict Reddit post engagement (log(1+score)) using only content at posting time, and how much additional predictive power comes from early comment activity?\nCan we automatically classify the emotional tone of Reddit posts (positive, negative, neutral) at scale using supervised learning?\nCan we identify inauthentic promotional accounts versus genuine users in audio product discussions?\nWhat underlying pain-point clusters exist in wireless earbud discussions, and how do these clusters differ across subreddits and communities?\n\nSee BUSINESS_QUESTIONS.md for detailed technical approaches."

    "text": "Key Findings Preview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways at a Glance\n\n\n\nOur analysis shows that:\n\nEngagement is highly concentrated in a few core communities (headphones, audiophile), with clear peak posting windows during U.S. daytime and mid-week.\n\nUsers are most satisfied with sound quality, comfort, and ANC, but show strong negative emotions around durability, battery life, and connectivity.\n\nEarly comment activity is the single strongest predictor of final engagement, far outweighing content-only features and confirming a strong social snowball effect in Reddit’s ranking dynamics.\n\n\n\n\nMajor Insights\n\nEDA – Centralized Ecosystem & Temporal Rhythms:\nA small number of general audio communities drive nearly 70% of all activity, with engagement peaking during U.S. mornings and mid-week. Timing and community choice matter more than title length or post format.\nNLP – Performance vs. Reliability Trade-offs:\nRedditors consistently praise sound, comfort, and ANC, but express concentrated frustration about durability, battery degradation, app bugs, and connectivity issues. Emotion analysis reveals where users feel delight vs. disappointment.\nML – Early Social Proof Drives Virality:\nContent-only models explain little of engagement variance (R² ≈ 0.12), while adding early comment features boosts R² to ~0.48. Just five early-comment features provide more predictive power than 5,000+ text features.\n\n\n\nBusiness Impact\nThese findings translate unstructured Reddit discussions into actionable consumer intelligence. Brands can:\n\nRefine product roadmaps by investing in durability, battery, and connectivity improvements while preserving strengths in sound and comfort.\n\nTarget the most impactful communities and posting windows to maximize organic reach and feedback.\n\nDesign launch and engagement strategies that explicitly optimize the first hour of discussion, leveraging early social proof to drive long-term visibility and influence purchase decisions."

    "text": "Business Question 3: What emotional reactions do Reddit users express toward different earbud features?\nQuestion: Which features trigger the strongest emotional responses—positive or negative—and how do these emotions differ across the earbud experience?\n\n\n\n\nEmotion Pain Points\n\n\n\nTop Pain Points by Negative Mentions\n\n\nKey Emotional Drivers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nPrimary Positive Signal\nPrimary Negative Signal\n\n\n\n\nSound Quality\nJoy\nMild negativity\n\n\nANC\nJoy\nLow anger\n\n\nComfort\nJoy\nLow negativity\n\n\nConnectivity\n—\nHigh anger\n\n\nDurability\n—\nHighest negativity\n\n\nBattery\nJoy\nSadness / fatigue\n\n\nPrice\nJoy\nFairness frustration\n\n\nMic Quality\nJoy\nModerate negativity\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Insights & Interpretation\n\n1. Reliability failures (durability, connectivity) generate the strongest negative emotions\n\nDurability shows the highest concentration of anger and sadness across all features.\n\n→ Users feel both immediate frustration (anger) and long-term disappointment (sadness) when earbuds break, degrade, or fail over time.\n\nWater Resistance shows the highe concentrations of anger and sadness across all features.\nConnectivity displays elevated anger with relatively low joy.\n\n→ Bluetooth instability tends to produce acute, high-intensity irritation — a “deal-breaker” emotion.\n\n\nImplication: These issues damage brand trust and are likely the top drivers of negative reviews, product returns, and churn. Fixing reliability problems yields outsized UX and retention gains.\n\n\n\n2. Battery issues evoke disappointment, not rage\n\nBattery-related discussions lean toward sadness over anger, signaling a softer but still negative emotional tone.\n\n→ Users don’t feel blindsided — instead they feel let down, especially when batteries age sooner than expected.\n\n\nImplication: Battery anxiety is more about expectation mismatch than catastrophic failure. Managing expectations and communicating battery longevity honestly can reduce the emotional burden without needing major hardware redesigns.\n\n\n\n3. Core listening features (sound_quality, ANC, comfort) generate the highest joy\n\nSound quality, ANC, and comfort consistently produce strong joy and trust signals — the most positive emotional categories.\nThese features have the lowest levels of anger, disgust, and fear, showing stable satisfaction.\n\nImplication: These are primary value-creation features. When brands excel in these areas, users reward them with strong emotional positivity, leading to higher willingness to recommend and stronger brand affinity.\n\n\n\n4. Mic quality and transparency mode produce mixed emotions\n\nBoth show moderate joy/trust but also noticeable sadness or frustration.\nUsers appreciate these features, but performance is inconsistent across brands and models.\n\nImplication: These represent opportunity zones: not as emotionally volatile as durability, but with clear room to differentiate through better execution.\n\n\n\n5. Price drives trust and positive sentiment — but still triggers negativity when expectations aren’t met\n\nPrice surprisingly registers higher trust and joy compared to other “non-technical” features.\nYet negative emotions appear when users feel the product under-delivers relative to cost.\n\nImplication: Pricing influences emotional framing: - A reasonable price boosts trust, but disappointment becomes more intense when expectations don’t match the price tag.\n\n\n\n\nOverall Insights & Business Takeaways\nNegative emotions are concentrated in failure-prone features\n\nDurability\nConnectivity\nBattery\n\nThese features create emotional pain points that directly impact retention, brand loyalty, and review scores.\nPositive emotions cluster around experiential qualities\n\nSound quality\nANC\nComfort\n\n\n\nSummary\nThe emotion heatmap shows that failures feel personal, but great audio experiences feel meaningful. Users express deep frustration over reliability issues (durability, connectivity, battery), but strong joy and trust toward experiential features (sound, ANC, comfort). These emotional patterns reveal not just product performance, but how each feature contributes to — or detracts from — the overall user experience, helping identify the biggest opportunities for product improvement and competitive differentiation."

    "text": "Answers to All 10 Business Questions\n\nEDA Questions\n\nHow does public discussion about audio products evolve over time?\nDiscussions peak during U.S. daytime hours (15:00–20:00 UTC) and mid-week (Tuesday–Friday). headphones and audiophile dominate activity, accounting for nearly 70% of all comments.\nWhich product communities attract the highest engagement?\nGeneral audio subreddits significantly outperform brand-specific communities in score, comment volume, and posting frequency. audiophile and headphones act as central hubs, while airpods leads among brand subs.\nHow does post timing and structure relate to discussion depth?\nEngagement is strongly tied to post visibility (r = 0.685 between score and comments) and optimal timing (Tuesdays around 14:00 UTC). Title length and post type have negligible impact.\n\n\n\n\nNLP Questions\n\nWhat features and sentiments are most discussed about wireless earbuds?\nThe most discussed features are price, sound quality, battery, ANC, comfort, and durability. Overall sentiment is moderately positive, but durability, battery, and app performance are the core pain points.\nWhich earbud brands dominate controversial discussion and sentiment?\nSony and Bose dominate technical performance discussions with generally positive sentiment. Samsung shows the highest proportion of negative discussion, while Beats has the highest positive ratio.\nWhat emotional reactions do users express toward different features?\nDurability and connectivity trigger the strongest anger and sadness, while sound quality, ANC, and comfort generate joy and trust, indicating clear emotional separation across feature experiences.\nHow did public sentiment respond to the AirPods Pro USB-C launch?\nThe launch caused a 3.2× spike in discussion volume. Sentiment declined slightly (-9.5%) due to value and ecosystem concerns, but remained net positive. USB-C standardization was welcomed but seen as an incremental upgrade.\n\n\n\n\nML Questions\n\nHow well can we predict post engagement using content vs. early comments?\nContent-only models achieved R² = 0.12, while adding early comments boosted performance to R² = 0.48. Early engagement is the dominant predictor of final popularity.\nCan we classify Reddit post sentiment at scale?\nThe sentiment classifier achieved ~85% accuracy, but negative class recall remains low due to class imbalance and subtle expression of negative sentiment.\nCan we identify inauthentic promotional accounts versus genuine users in audio product discussions?\nBot detection achieved 99.5% accuracy using behavioral features. Temporal patterns (posting hour variance) are the strongest signal (39.4%), while activity longevity separates promotional campaigns from genuine users (17.9%).\nWhat underlying painpoint clusters exist in Reddit discussions about wireless earbuds?\nK-Means clustering identified 9 distinct painpoint clusters (k=9 via silhouette score). Each subreddit has a unique “complaint fingerprint”: audiophile/audio focus on sound quality, bluetooth emphasizes connectivity, while BuyItForLife/running prioritize durability."

    "text": "Addressing the High-Level Problem\nOriginal Problem Statement:\nThe wireless audio market exceeds $50B annually, but brands struggle to understand real-time consumer preferences, product pain points, and competitive dynamics from authentic consumer conversation.\nHow Our Analysis Addresses It:\nOur integrated EDA, NLP, and ML pipeline converts raw social chatter into structured business intelligence. EDA reveals where and when engagement concentrates, NLP exposes what users care about emotionally and functionally, and ML quantifies how engagement actually forms and propagates. Together, these outputs enable companies to: - Detect feature-level pain points - Track brand-level sentiment and controversy - Measure launch reception - Forecast engagement and virality This directly supports product design, marketing strategy, and competitive positioning."

    "text": "Final Thoughts\nThis project demonstrates how large-scale social media analytics can be transformed into real, actionable consumer intelligence. By combining big data infrastructure with NLP and machine learning, we uncovered not only what users say about audio products, but how they feel, how they influence one another, and what ultimately drives visibility and success. The methods developed here are fully transferable to other consumer technology domains and provide a strong foundation for future market intelligence systems."

    "text": "Business Question 3: Can we identify inauthentic promotional accounts versus genuine users in audio product discussions?\n\nProblem Formulation\n\nTask Type: Binary Classification\nTarget Variable: is_suspicious (1 = bot/promotional, 0 = authentic user)\nEvaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC, AUC-PR\nDataset: 145,234 unique users across audio-related subreddits\n\nGoal: Detect suspicious posting patterns indicating bots, promotional accounts, or astroturfing campaigns to ensure authentic consumer insights inform business decisions.\n\n\n\nFeature Engineering: User Behavioral Patterns\nWe analyze 14 user-level features derived from posting behavior:\nPosting Volume Indicators: - total_comments - Overall activity level - active_days - Days with at least one comment - comments_per_day - Posting frequency - activity_span_days - Days between first and last comment\nCommunity Diversity Signals: - subreddit_diversity - Number of unique subreddits - Suspicious: Brand-focused accounts post only in one brand’s subreddit - Authentic: Users participate across multiple communities\nTemporal Pattern Analysis: - posting_hour_variance - Consistency in posting times - Suspicious: Bots post at identical times (low variance) - Authentic: Humans have irregular schedules (high variance) - avg_posting_hour - Average hour of activity\nEngagement Quality Metrics: - avg_comment_score - Average upvotes received - score_variance - Variance in comment reception - upvoted_comments - Count of positively-received comments - upvote_rate - Percentage of comments with &gt;1 upvote\nText Pattern Signals: - avg_comment_length - Average characters per comment - text_length_variance - Consistency in comment length - short_comment_rate - Percentage of very brief comments (&lt;20 chars)\n\n\n\nSuspicious User Labeling\nUsers are flagged as suspicious if they exhibit any of:\n\nHigh-volume, low-diversity accounts: total_comments &gt; 100 AND subreddit_diversity &lt; 3\nGeneric spam patterns: short_comment_rate &gt; 0.7 AND avg_comment_score &lt; 2\nUnnatural posting frequency: comments_per_day &gt; 20\nBot-like temporal consistency: posting_hour_variance &lt; 1.0\n\nLabel Distribution: - Authentic users: 140,103 (96.5%) - Suspicious accounts: 5,131 (3.5%)\nLimitation: These labels reflect our heuristics, not verified bots. Model performance measures how well it learns these patterns, not true bot detection accuracy.\n\n\n\nModel Performance Results\nAlgorithm: Random Forest (100 trees, max depth 8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric\nScore\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy\n99.52%\nCorrectly classifies 99.5% of users\n\n\nPrecision\n99.52%\n99.5% of flagged accounts are actually suspicious\n\n\nRecall\n99.52%\nCatches 99.5% of suspicious accounts\n\n\nF1 Score\n99.52%\nExcellent balance of precision and recall\n\n\nAUC-ROC\n0.9998\nNear-perfect discrimination ability\n\n\nAUC-PR\n0.9999\nRobust even with class imbalance\n\n\n\nInterpretation: The model achieves near-perfect reproduction of rule-based patterns with minimal false positives/negatives. High performance indicates:\n\nFeatures successfully capture the patterns defined by our heuristics\nThe model generalizes these patterns (not just memorizing exact thresholds)\nFeature interactions beyond simple rules are being learned\n\nCaveat: Performance is measured against rule-based labels, not ground-truth bot annotations. This represents an upper bound on detection capability.\nConfusion Matrix:\n\n\n\nBot Detection Confusion Matrix\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature Importance Analysis\n\n\n\nFeature Importance for Bot Detection\n\n\nTop 5 Most Predictive Features:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\nFeature\nImportance\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\n1\nposting_hour_variance\n39.4%\nTemporal consistency is the strongest bot signal\n\n\n2\nactivity_span_days\n17.9%\nShort-lived accounts are suspicious\n\n\n3\nactive_days\n15.7%\nBots have unnatural activity patterns\n\n\n4\ntext_length_variance\n9.2%\nRepetitive comment lengths signal automation\n\n\n5\ntotal_comments\n7.6%\nVolume matters (bots post prolifically)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Insights\n1. Temporal Patterns Are the Strongest Signal (39.4%) - Bots post on automated schedules with low hour variance - Humans have irregular activity patterns (work, sleep, weekends) - Example: Posts daily at 9am, 3pm, 9pm (variance &lt; 1.0) = suspicious\n2. Activity Longevity Matters (17.9%) - Promotional campaigns have short lifespans (days to weeks) - Authentic enthusiasts participate for months/years - Short activity_span_days separates flash campaigns from genuine users\n3. Text Consistency Reveals Automation (9.2%) - Bots post similar-length comments (templates, scripts) - Humans write varied lengths based on context - Low text_length_variance detects copy-paste behavior\n4. Subreddit Diversity is Less Important (0.6%) - Many authentic users are brand loyalists - Temporal and text patterns are better discriminators - Brand-only posting is necessary but not sufficient for detection\n\n\n\nBusiness Implications\n1. Protect Data Quality for Consumer Insights - Filter suspicious accounts before sentiment analysis - Apply bot detector to user IDs before aggregating feedback - Ensure reliable consumer insights by removing 3.5% bot contamination\n2. Community Trust & Platform Health - Flag accounts with &gt;90% bot probability for moderator review - Implement automated rate limiting for suspicious patterns - Maintain authentic discussions in audio product communities\n3. Competitive Intelligence Applications - Detect competitor astroturfing campaigns - Identify coordinated promotion of specific brands - Track emergence of new promotional tactics\n4. Real-Time Monitoring System - Calculate 14 behavioral features for each user weekly - Run Random Forest model on all active users - Tiered response: High confidence (&gt;95%) → shadowban, Medium (80-95%) → manual review\n\n\n\nSummary\nMain Findings: - Developed rule-based suspicious behavior detection with 99.5% model accuracy at reproducing patterns - Temporal patterns (posting hour variance) are the strongest distinguishing signal (39.4%) - Activity longevity separates promotional campaigns from genuine users (17.9%) - Model successfully learns feature interactions beyond simple threshold rules\nWhat This Demonstrates: - Behavioral features effectively distinguish suspicious patterns from organic users - Machine learning adds value by learning feature importance and combinations - Framework is ready for validation with ground-truth bot labels when available\nBusiness Value: - Provides baseline for identifying suspicious accounts in Reddit discussions - Feature importance guides manual review prioritization - Framework can be extended with verified bot examples for true validation\nKey Recommendation: Use this model as a first-pass filter to flag accounts for manual review. 99.5% accuracy reflects pattern learning, not verified bot detection. Validate flagged accounts manually before excluding from business analysis."
